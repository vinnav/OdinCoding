Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

Alternative Box Model

box-sizing: border-box;

In the alternative box model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page.
