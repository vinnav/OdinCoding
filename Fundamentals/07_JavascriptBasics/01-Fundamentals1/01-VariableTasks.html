    // Assign the value "John" to name.
    // Copy the value from name to admin.
    // Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

    //Examine the following code:
    const birthday = '18.04.1982';
    const age = someCode(birthday);
    // Here we have a constant birthday date and the age is calculated from birthday with the help of some code 
    // (it is not provided for shortness, and because details don’t matter here).
    // Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?
    const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make uppercase?
    const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make uppercase?
    // it makes sense for BIRTHDAY since it's hard coded and unchanging, not so much for age
